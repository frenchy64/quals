\section*{Question 2}

\begin{verbatim}
Examine the use of Clojure's core.spec contract system in several
real world code bases. Look at what features are used, and how precise
specifications are. Analyze how specifications address the lack of
higher-order contracts by looking at the frequency of higher-order function
contracts vs higher-order functions that omit specifications of higher-order
arguments or results.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{What spec features are used in real systems}

\subsection*{How precise are spec annotations in practice?}

\subsection*{How frequently are higher-order functions annotated with higher-order specs? Why?}
