\section{Question 3}

\begin{verbatim}
Write a formal model of Clojure with core.spec, and implement it in
PLT Redex. Formulate a consistency property between contracted and
uncontracted execution, and test it in redex.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Formal model}

\input{syntax-figure-lambdac}

We devise a base formal model for Clojure called $\lambda c$.
We extend $\lambda c$ with clojure.spec without function contracts, and call
this model $\lambda c_s$. 
Then, we extend $\lambda c_s$ to support
clojure.spec function contracts, and call this final model $\lambda c_{s}^{f}$.

\subsection{Redex model}

We model $\lambda c$ as a Redex language called \emph{Clojure}.
The model includes also recursive functions and nil.

To explore Redex, we use an Eval-Apply-Continue machine
